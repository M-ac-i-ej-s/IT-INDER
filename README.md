# IT-INDER

The main purpose of the page was to the developers who are looking for a project
contact in the easiest way possible with the developers which have an idea but don't
have time/experience/knowledge to execute it. The algorithm matches people based on
their language preferences and then if both, the idea provider, and the programmer
'swipe right' they are able to communicate through chat to establish later details.

* React
* TypeScript
* Express
